# Realocator
Realocator will be a simple web app that allows people to:

•			Search for properties for sale in a specified location 

•            Make a shortlist of those preferred properties

•            Check the weather for those shortlisted properties

•            Have links to relevant sites such as www.domain.com.au and www.airbnb.com.au 


## Collaborators
Project One: Rodney Parker-Yules, Nicholas Strong, Trentan Jurkans and Sean Wallace.
