# Realocater
Find short term accomodation (or the weather) near where you want to buy property.

This real-world front-end application showcases the benefits for someone looking to buy a property (usually as an investment).  Realocater makes planning the visit to the community of the property easier (buy telling you the weather or nearby short term accomodation).

## Project Requirements

The technical requirements are:

* CSS framework other than Bootstrap: [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Use at least two [server-side APIs](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources).
	* domain.com.au API
	* airbnb.com.au or bookings.com API or weather API

* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

* Responsive.

* Polished UI.

* Has a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Has a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
